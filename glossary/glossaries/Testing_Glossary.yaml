    description: "<p>Bigquery Dataset Label What is Lorem Ipsum?</p><p><strong>Lorem\
      \ Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.\
      \ Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,\
      \ when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type\
      \ specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap\
      \ into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised\
      \ in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,\
      \ and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including\
      \ versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>"
