    description: "<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing\
      \ and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy\
      \ text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and\
      \ scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,\
      \ but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.\
      \ It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing\
      \ Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like\
      \ Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><h2>Why do we use it?</h2><p>It\
      \ is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable\
      \ content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum\
      \ is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to\
      \ using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.\
      \ Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum\
      \ as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many\
      \ web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,\
      \ sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p><p><br></p><h2>Where\
      \ does it come from?</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply\
      \ random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45\
      \ BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at\
      \ Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin\
      \ words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites\
      \ of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem\
      \ Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\"\
      \ (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is\
      \ a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The\
      \ first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a\
      \ line in section 1.10.32.</p><p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since\
      \ the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33\
      \ from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their\
      \ exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation\
      \ by H. Rackham.</p><h2>Where can I get some?</h2><p>There are many variations\
      \ of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration\
      \ in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even\
      \ slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you\
      \ need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of\
      \ text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined\
      \ chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.\
      \ It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model\
      \ sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated\
      \ Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or\
      \ non-characteristic words etc.</p>"
