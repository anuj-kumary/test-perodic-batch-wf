    description: |-
      The **Engagement Rate** measures how actively your audience is interacting with your content, usually in the form of likes, comments, and shares.

      $$latex
      \text{Engagement Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Engagements (Likes, Comments, Shares)}}{\text{Total Followers or Views}} \right) \times 100
      $$
