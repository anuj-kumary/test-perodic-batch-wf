      HealthVerity synchronizes transformational technologies with the nation’s largest healthcare and consumer data ecosystem to power previously unattainable outcomes and fundamentally advance science. HealthVerity offers hundreds of data sources across medical, pharmacy, lab, biomarker, EHR, consumer, and more.

      This sample high-fidelity synthetic dataset from HealthVerity represents 1,500+ synthetic patients modeled on de-identified medical and pharmacy claims. **This dataset is intended for educational rather than production purposes, and may be used solely in non-production settings for internal testing, evaluation and/or informational purposes, and may not be relied upon or used for general commercial use**. This is only a synthetic sample dataset meant to illustrate a small portion of the type and volume of Real-world Data that is available within the HealthVerity Marketplace ecosystem. HealthVerity would welcome the opportunity to learn more about your project, and determine the optimal patient data for your objective.
